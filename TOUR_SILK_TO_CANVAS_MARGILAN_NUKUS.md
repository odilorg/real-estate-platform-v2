## TESTIMONIALS (Placeholder - To Be Collected)

### Sarah M., Textile Designer, UK
*"I came for the silk, stayed for the people. Three days with Master Abdullo in Margilan was worth the entire trip. Watching my tied threads become an ikat scarf—I cried when it arrived 3 weeks later. This is how travel should be: transformative, not transactional."*

### Richard & Linda, Retired Teachers, USA
*"We've done 40+ countries, but this tour was different. Eating plov with Master Rustam's family, painting ceramics alongside Master Alisher's daughter, sleeping in a 200-year-old home in Bukhara—these are memories we'll treasure forever. And the Savitsky Museum? Mind-blowing."*

### Akiko, Ceramic Artist, Japan
*"As a professional potter, I was skeptical about 'tourist workshops.' But Master Alisher treated me like an apprentice, not a tourist. He taught me the Ishkor glaze formula (his family secret!). I now use it in my studio in Kyoto. Worth every penny."*
