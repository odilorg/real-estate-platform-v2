## 4. Uzbekistan-Specific Adaptations

### 4.1 Payment Methods & Currency

**Dual Currency Display:**
- **Primary Display:** UZS (Uzbekistani Som) - official currency
- **Secondary Display:** у.е. (conventional units, ~USD equivalent)
- **Reason:** Real estate commonly priced in USD equivalents but transacted in UZS
- **Implementation:**
  - Property price input: UZS + auto-calculate у.е. based on exchange rate
  - Exchange rate updated daily (API from Central Bank of Uzbekistan)
  - Filter/search supports both currencies
  - Reports show both UZS and у.е.

**Payment Tracking:**
- Bank transfer (mandatory for foreign buyers, common for all)
- Cash (still used in some transactions)
- Installment plans (common for new developments)
- Mark payment milestones (deposit paid, full payment, registration paid)

### 4.2 Regulatory Compliance Features

**License Verification:**
- Store agent license number
- License expiration tracking (alert 30 days before)
- Link to Ministry of Justice verification system (future)

**AML Compliance:**
- Client verification checklist (passport, proof of funds, source of funds)
- Flag high-risk transactions (large cash, foreign buyer, politically exposed person)
- Required document upload for AML (passport copy, proof of funds)
- AML report generation for regulatory submission

**Notary Integration (Future):**
- Schedule notary appointments
- Track notary fees (auto-calculate based on property price)
- Notary appointment reminders
- Integration with notary offices (future API)

**Registration Tracking:**
- Track registration status with Unified State Real Estate Cadastre
- Registration timeline (submitted, in progress, completed)
- Registration number storage
- Alert when registration completed

### 4.3 Communication Norms

**Telegram-First:**
- Telegram is PRIMARY communication channel (88% adoption)
- Click-to-Telegram from every client profile
- Telegram bot for quick actions
- Telegram notifications for all critical events

**WhatsApp Secondary:**
- WhatsApp support for clients who prefer it
- Click-to-WhatsApp from client profile

**Phone Calls:**
- Phone still important (especially older clients, official conversations)
- Call logging feature
- Click-to-call from mobile app

**In-Person Meetings:**
- Cultural norm: trust built through face-to-face interaction
- Office visit tracking (walk-in client log)
- Meeting notes and follow-up scheduling

**Language Preference:**
- Track preferred language per client (Russian/Uzbek/English)
- Send communications in client's preferred language

### 4.4 Mobile-First Considerations

**Smartphone Penetration:**
- 77% smartphone penetration (2025)
- 90% of users access internet via mobile
- 93.4% of mobile traffic is 4G (fast, reliable)

**Design Implications:**
- Mobile app is PRIMARY interface (not secondary)
- Desktop version for admins, but mobile must have 100% feature parity
- Progressive Web App (PWA) preferred (no app store approval, instant updates)
- Offline mode critical (agents work in areas with spotty coverage)
- Data optimization (minimize data usage, many users have limited data plans)

**Agent Workflow:**
- Agents work in the field (showing properties, meeting clients at cafes)
- Quick actions on mobile (add lead, log call, update status in < 30 seconds)
- Voice notes for quick logging (instead of typing)
- Photo upload from mobile (property photos, client documents)

### 4.5 Local Property Types & Terminology

**Property Types (Russian/Uzbek):**
- Квартира (Kvartira) - Apartment
- Дом (Dom) - House
- Таунхаус (Townhouse) - Townhouse
- Коммерческая недвижимость (Commercial) - Commercial Property
- Земельный участок (Land) - Land Plot
- Новостройка (Novostroyka) - New Construction
- Вторичка (Vtorichka) - Secondary Market (resale)

**Location Terminology:**
- Район (Rayon) - District (Tashkent has 12 districts)
- Массив (Massiv) - Residential area/neighborhood
- Метро (Metro) - Metro station (critical for property value in Tashkent)
- Центр (Tsentr) - City center

**Features:**
- Евроремонт (Evroremont) - European-style renovation (high-quality finish)
- Капитальный ремонт - Major renovation
- Черновая отделка - Rough finish (no interior finishing)
- Индивидуальное отопление - Individual heating
- Парковка - Parking

### 4.6 Cultural Considerations

**Relationship-Driven:**
- Trust is paramount in Uzbek business culture
- Agents rely on personal networks, referrals
- CRM should support relationship tracking (how do you know this client? who referred them?)

**Family Orientation:**
- Property buying often involves entire family (parents, siblings)
- Multi-generational housing common
- Track family members in client profile (decision makers)

**Negotiation Culture:**
- Haggling is expected, even for expensive properties
- Track negotiation history (offers, counteroffers)
- Flexible pricing (price negotiable vs firm price)

**Religious Considerations:**
- Friday is holy day (mosques, family time)
- Ramadan: business slows, adjust expectations
- Calendar should mark religious holidays

## 12. Conclusion

The Uzbekistan real estate agency market presents a compelling opportunity for a specialized CRM solution. With 267 agencies (90% single-owner), high mobile adoption (92.2% penetration), and a severe digitalization gap (64.8% of agencies without websites), there is clear demand for professional tools.

**Key Success Factors:**

1. **Mobile-First Design:** 90% of users access internet via mobile - CRM must be mobile-native
2. **Telegram Integration:** 88% adoption rate makes Telegram the primary communication channel
3. **Simplicity:** Avoid feature bloat - focus on core workflows (lead → deal → closed)
4. **Local Compliance:** Built-in AML, license tracking, notary workflow support
5. **Bilingual Support:** Russian (primary) + Uzbek (secondary) for inclusivity
6. **Dual Currency:** UZS + у.е. (USD equivalent) display
7. **Freemium/Low-Cost Entry:** Agencies accustomed to free tools (Excel, WhatsApp) need low barrier to entry

**Competitive Advantage:**

No competitor (OLX.uz, Makler.uz, etc.) offers professional agency CRM tools. They focus on consumer listings, not agency workflows. This is our blue ocean opportunity.

**Recommended Next Steps:**

1. Build MVP with P0 features (8-10 weeks)
2. Onboard 5-10 pilot agencies (free 3-month trial)
3. Iterate based on feedback
4. Launch publicly with case studies
5. Scale via referrals and targeted marketing
